<p>
	I generally accept one new PhD student per year. Please get in touch if you have a very good Mathematics degree (Masters or MMath level) with a strong component of probability or statistics courses. I am happy to supervise any topic related to my research interests. You can choose your own or select one from the list below:

<p>Extensive use of renewable electricity generation is one of the main methods to reduce the carbon footprint of our society and to lower an ecological impact of the growing economy. 
Incorporation of low-carbon generation into national networks brings in new challenges which have to be addressed to avoid jeopardising ecological potential of these new technologies. 
The aim of this project is to address the problem of balancing of electricity network using methods of optimal control and optimal stopping of diffusions and jump-diffusions. There is an opportunity to give
more theoretical or more applied spin to the research depending on strengths and interests of the student. For more details, see <a href="docs/PhD_electricity.pdf" target="_blank">project description</a>.

In the recent years, electronic transactions and record keeping together with cheap data storage has resulted in accumulation of massive amounts of data containing valuable
information. Examples of such vast data sets are electronic patient records in the health sector or loyalty card data in the retail sector. The wealth of information in these data
sets is at the moment under-explored as any analysis and inference is hampered by the size of the datasets.</p>
<p>
To address this issue, machine learning techniques in biomedical, consumer data and other fields have seen rapid advances of algorithms and their implementations [3].
However, very little progress has been made in analysis of longitudinal data, i.e., the data with events and observations spaced irregularly over time [2]. Existing statistical and
machine learning methods cannot be directly applied since that data are heterogeneous with a varying number of events per record. Available algorithms are computationally
very intensive and do not scale well (see, e.g., [1, 4]). This project will attempt to change this by looking at the data from a new point of view: a
probabilistic approach that represents longitudinal data as a continuous-time stochastic processes and links to a large theory of stochastic processes. This modeling approach
promises to be
<ul>
<li>robust with respect to temporal inaccuracies often encountered in this type of data,</li>
<li>scalable allowing for exploration of large data sets.</li>
</ul>
The aim of this project is to realise this potential. You will develop new mathematical techniques and new algorithms and apply them to medical and consumer data sets
available in Leeds Insitute of Data Analytics. This is a joint PhD proposal with Georgios Aivaliotis.
</p>

<p>This project will appeal to applicants with a strong statistical and/or mathematical background who enjoy programming.</p>

The immense scale of modern data calls for new methods and algorithms that are parallel in the instances and variable dimensions, and self-adjust according to characteristics of the
data to reduce computational complexity. Techniques such as parallel boosting (see [3] and references therein; [2] for Google’s use of the technique) or algorithmic leveraging [4] rest on randomly sampling small subsets and have enjoyed some success in specific applications.</p>

<p>In this project, using techniques from the control and stopping of partially observable stochastic dynamical systems [1], you will extend ideas behind parallel versions of boosting.
This can include design of adaptive algorithms that self-adjust according to the complexity of the data and the performance of already trained model parts, thereby informing trade-offs between speed and accuracy. You will develop new mathematical techniques and new algorithms. Medical and consumer data sets available in Leeds Insitute of Data Analytics will form your test bed. This is a joint PhD proposal with Georgios Aivaliotis.</p>
