<p>
I will only accept new PhD students for a start in 2020 or later.</p>

<p>
	I generally accept one new PhD student per year. Please get in touch if you have a very good Mathematics degree (Masters or MMath level) with a strong component of probability or statistics courses. I am happy to supervise any topic related to my research interests. You can choose your own or select one from the list below:
